# 🏠 Power BI and Python for Real Estate Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling

This repository contains the implementation of my thesis project:  
**Application of Power BI and Python for real estate data analysis and predictive modelling in Hungary.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Data analysis plays a crucial role in economic decision-making and understanding market trends.  
Real estate data is particularly important as it directly impacts both businesses and households.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the **integrated use of Power BI and Python** for data analysis and predictive modelling, focusing on the Hungarian real estate market.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Theoretical background** – Introduction to data analysis, data architectures (Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Lakehouse), and the role of Power BI & Python.  
- **Data collection & preparation** – Identification of real estate data sources, data cleaning and transformation using Power Query (M language) and Python.  
- **Power BI analysis** – Data modelling, DAX calculations, interactive visualizations and dashboards.  
- **Python predictive modelling** – Development of predictive models (e.g., SARIMAX, Prophet) and integration into Power BI.  
- **Integration analysis** – Evaluation of benefits and limitations of combining Power BI with Python.  
- **Results & documentation** – Presentation of insights through interactive dashboards and predictive forecasts.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modelling, visualization, DAX measures.  
- **Power Query (M language)** – ETL processes: data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- **Python (Visual Studio Code)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and predictive modelling.  
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `prophet`  
- **Power BI & Python Integration** – Embedding Python scripts into Power BI for advanced analytics.
